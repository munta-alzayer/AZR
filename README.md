# AZR

During my time at AZR I developed a few scripts that were used in production to QC and analyze data retrieved from oil rigs. 

## Python Scripts
These are Python scripts that were used during the process of analyzing the data and quality controlling it before it was sent to Saudi Aramco

### Curvenames QC Script

This script will run through the curve names used by the Geoscience team and make sure it matches the naming convention provided by our customer.

### TOTAL METAL LOSS (TML) 
This script will run through the TML percentage and calculate it based on difference between nominal and detected thickness.
